# Bellabeat_Marketing_Analysis

### Project Overview


In this case study, we will work for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat knows that an analysis of available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to analyze smart device usage data to gain insight into how people already use their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

### Data Sources

[Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data:](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty Fitbit users, including heart rate, steps, sleep monitoring and information about daily activity that can be used to explore usersâ€™ habits. 


### Tools

- Excel - Data preprocessing
- R - Data analysis
- Tableau - Creating visualizations

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Data cleaning and formatting.

### Data Analysis

- Following R code investigate the number of everyday consumers.

#### Installing and loading common packages and libraries

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```
#### Loading CSV files

Here we'll create a dataframe named 'daily_activity' by doing union between two CSV files from the dataset.

```{r}
daily_activity_apr <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged_mar-apr.csv")
daily_activity_may <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged_apr-may.csv")
```

```{r}
daily_activity <- rbind(daily_activity_apr,daily_activity_may)
```

#### Exploring the table

```{r}
colnames(daily_activity)
```

```{r}
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
```

#### Finding the percentage of everyday consumers

The normal values for daily steps, calories burned and sedentary minutes for females can vary but we can segment everday consumers by applying general boundary values.

```{r}
everyday_consumer <- daily_activity %>%
  filter(TotalSteps > 5000 &
         Calories > 1200 &
         SedentaryMinutes < 8*60) %>%
  summarise(percentage = n_distinct(Id) / n_distinct(daily_activity$Id) * 100)
```

```{r}
everyday_consumer$percentage
```


### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. Everyday consumers are among the primary users of smart products; from the above analysis using R, they are approximately 17 %. 

2. MET is used to estimate the intensity of physical activities, but users with low METs also have higher heart rates. This reflects that these smart wearables are used by Athletes, Fitness Enthusiasts and patients as well.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Create segments based on behaviour patterns such as trip length and timing of bike usage and identify the daily subscribers who demonstrate patterns similar to annual members in terms of usage.

- Highlight how an annual membership provides unlimited bike access, encouraging more frequent and varied usage.

- Provide incentives such as free months, discounted rates, or bonus ride credits to encourage conversion.

- Organize community events or group rides to engage current daily subscribers and showcase annual membership benefits.

- Incorporate user feedback to refine and improve the conversion process over time.

### Limitations

In this analysis, the sample consists of 35 observations. To increase the accuracy of the results, more observations are needed.
